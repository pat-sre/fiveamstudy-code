The Hesperian period (beginning 3.5 billion years ago and ending 3.3–2.9 billion years ago) was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which continues to the present is the currently dominating and remaining influence on geological processes.

Mars is the only presently known example of a desert planet, a rocky planet with a surface akin to that of Earth's deserts. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide (nanophase Fe2O3) and the iron(III) oxide-hydroxide mineral goethite.[42] It can look like butterscotch;[43] other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.[43]\\n\", '\\n', 'Internal structure\\n', '\\n', 'Internal structure of Mars[44][45]\\n', 'Mapped gravity field of Mars\\n', \"Like Earth, Mars is differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense rocky layers.[46][47] The outermost layer is the crust, which is on average about 42–56 kilometres (26–35 mi) thick,[48] with a minimum thickness of 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) in Isidis Planitia, and a maximum thickness of 117 kilometres (73 mi) in the southern Tharsis plateau.[49] For comparison, Earth's crust averages 27.3 ± 4.8 km in thickness.[50] The most abundant elements in the Martian crust are silicon, oxygen, iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium, and potassium.

Below this the mantle gradually becomes more ductile, and the seismic wave velocity starts to grow again.[54] The Martian mantle does not appear to have a thermally insulating layer analogous to Earth's lower mantle; instead, below 1050 km in depth, it becomes mineralogically similar to Earth's transition zone.[44] At the bottom of the mantle lies a basal liquid silicate layer approximately 150–180 km thick.[45][55] The Martian mantle appears to be highly heterogenous, with dense fragments up to 4 km across, likely injected deep into the planet by colossal impacts ~4.5 billion years ago; high-frequency waves from eight marsquakes slowed as they passed these localized regions, and modeling indicates the heterogeneities are compositionally distinct debris preserved because Mars lacks plate tectonics and has a sluggishly convecting interior that prevents complete homogenization.[56][57]\\n\", '\\n', \"Mars's iron and nickel core is at least partially molten, and may have a solid inner core.[58][59][60] It is around half of Mars's radius, approximately 1650–1675 km, and is enriched in light elements such as sulfur, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.[61][62] The temperature of the core is estimated to be 2000–2400 K,[63] compared to 5400–6230 K for Earth's solid inner core.

Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass.

One hypothesis, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.[81]\\n\", '\\n', 'Geography and features\\n', '\\n', 'Main article: Geography of Mars\\n', 'Further information: Areoid\\n', 'See also: Category:Surface features of Mars\\n', '\\n', 'Topographical map of Mars with features labeled and the Martian dichotomy visible (northern low lying and southern highland hemispheres)\\n', \"Although better remembered for mapping the Moon, Johann Heinrich von Mädler and Wilhelm Beer were the first areographers.

For example, Nix Olympica (the snows of Olympus) has become Olympus Mons (Mount Olympus).[84] The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is divided into two kinds of areas, with differing albedo. The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian \"continents\" and given names like Arabia Terra (land of Arabia) or Amazonis Planitia (Amazonian plain). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names Mare Erythraeum, Mare Sirenum and Aurorae Sinus.

W. Campbell at Lick Observatory observed the planet and found that \"if water vapor or oxygen occur in the atmosphere of Mars it is in quantities too small to be detected by spectroscopes then available\".[264] That observation contradicted many of the measurements of the time and was not widely accepted.[264] Campbell and V. M. Slipher repeated the study in 1909 using better instruments, but with the same results. It was not until the findings were confirmed by W. S. Adams in 1925 that the myth of the Earth-like habitability of Mars was finally broken.[264] However, even in the 1960s, articles were published on Martian biology, putting aside explanations other than life for the seasonal changes on Mars.[265]\\n', '\\n', \"The current understanding of planetary habitability – the ability of a world to develop environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life – favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun is estimated to extend from within the orbit of Earth to about that of Mars.[266] During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.[267]\\n\", '\\n', 'The environmental conditions on Mars are a challenge to sustaining organic life: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, it has poor insulation against bombardment by the solar wind due to the absence of a magnetosphere and has insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead sublimes to a gaseous state). Mars is nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.[268]\\n', '\\n', 'Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The Viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase in CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that Viking may have found life.[269] A 2014 analysis of Martian meteorite EETA79001 found chlorate, perchlorate, and nitrate ions in sufficiently high concentrations to suggest that they are widespread on Mars. UV and X-ray radiation would turn chlorate and perchlorate ions into other, highly reactive oxychlorines, indicating that any organic molecules would have to be buried under the surface to survive.[270]\\n', '\\n', 'Small quantities of methane and formaldehyde detected by Mars orbiters are both claimed to be possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere.[271][272] Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinite.[132] Impact glass, formed by the impact of meteors, which on Earth can preserve signs of life, has also been found on the surface of the impact craters on Mars.[273][274] Likewise, the glass in impact craters on Mars could have preserved signs of life, if life existed at the site.[275][276][277]\\n', '\\n', 'The Cheyava Falls rock discovered on Mars in June 2024 has been designated by NASA as a \"potential biosignature\" and was core sampled by the Perseverance rover for possible return to Earth and further examination. Although highly intriguing, no definitive final determination on a biological or abiotic origin of this rock can be made with the data currently available.[278]\\n', '\\n', 'Human mission proposals\\n', '\\n', 'A NASA ISRU system concept for autonomous robotic excavation and processing of Mars soil to extract water for use in exploration missions.\\n', 'Several plans for a human mission to Mars have been proposed, but none have come to fruition. The NASA Authorization Act of 2017 directed NASA to study the feasibility of a crewed Mars mission in the early 2030s; the resulting report concluded that this would be unfeasible.[279][280] In addition, in 2021, China was planning to send a crewed Mars mission in 2033.[281] Privately held companies such as SpaceX have also proposed plans to send humans to Mars, with the eventual goal to settle on the planet.[282] As of 2024, SpaceX has proceeded with the development of the Starship launch vehicle with the goal of Mars colonization. In plans shared with the company in April 2024, Elon Musk envisions the beginning of a Mars colony within the next twenty years. This would be enabled by the planned mass manufacturing of Starship and initially sustained by resupply from Earth, and in situ resource utilization on Mars, until the Mars colony reaches full self sustainability.[283] Any future human mission to Mars will likely take place within the optimal Mars launch window, which occurs every 26 months. The moon Phobos has been proposed as an anchor point for a space elevator.[284] Besides national space agencies and space companies, groups such as the Mars Society[285] and The Planetary Society[286] advocate for human missions to Mars.\\n', '\\n', 'In culture\\n', 'Main articles: Mars in culture and Mars in fiction\\n', 'See also: Planets in astrology § Mars\\n', '\\n', 'The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells, 1897, depicts an invasion of Earth by fictional Martians.\\n', 'Mars is named after the Roman god of war (Greek Ares), but was also associated with the demi-god Heracles (Roman Hercules) by ancient Greek astronomers, as detailed by Aristotle.[287] This association between Mars and war dates back at least to Babylonian astronomy, in which the planet was named for the god Nergal, deity of war and destruction.[288][289] It persisted into modern times, as exemplified by Gustav Holst\\'s orchestral suite The Planets, whose famous first movement labels Mars \"the bringer of war\".[290] The planet\\'s symbol, a circle with a spear pointing out to the upper right, is also used as a symbol for the male gender.[291] The symbol dates from at least the 11th century, though a possible predecessor has been found in the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri.[292]\\n', '\\n', 'The idea that Mars was populated by intelligent Martians became widespread in the late 19th century. Schiaparelli\\'s \"canali\" observations combined with Percival Lowell\\'s books on the subject put forward the standard notion of a planet that was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works.[293] Many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities added to what has been termed \"Mars Fever\".[294] In the present day, high-resolution mapping of the surface of Mars has revealed no artifacts of habitation, but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on Mars still continues. Reminiscent of the canali observations, these speculations are based on small scale features perceived in the spacecraft images, such as \"pyramids\" and the \"Face on Mars\".[295] In his book Cosmos, planetary astronomer Carl Sagan wrote: \"Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our Earthly hopes and fears.\"[238]\\n', '\\n', \"The depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth-century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent life.[296] This gave way to many science fiction stories involving these concepts, such as H. G. Wells's The War of the Worlds, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth; Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, in which human explorers accidentally destroy a Martian civilization; as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs's series Barsoom, C. S. Lewis's novel Out of the Silent Planet (1938),[297] and a number of Robert A. Heinlein stories before the mid-sixties.[298] Since then, depictions of Martians have also extended to animation. A comic figure of an intelligent Martian, Marvin the Martian, appeared in Haredevil Hare (1948) as a character in the Looney Tunes animated cartoons of Warner Brothers, and has continued as part of popular culture to the present.[299] After the Mariner and Viking spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as a lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars were abandoned; for many science-fiction authors, the new discoveries initially seemed like a constraint, but eventually the post-Viking knowledge of Mars became itself a source of inspiration for works like Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy.[300]\\n\", '\\n', 'See also\\n', 'Astronomy on Mars\\n', 'Outline of Mars – Overview of and topical guide to Mars\\n', 'List of missions to Mars\\n', 'Magnetic field of Mars – Past magnetic field of the planet Mars\\n', 'Mineralogy of Mars\\n', 'Notes\\n', ' The light filters are 635 nm, 546 nm, and 437 nm, roughly corresponding to red, green and blue respectively\\n', ' Best-fit ellipsoid\\n', 'References\\n', ' Simon J, Bretagnon P, Chapront J, et al.
