# 5 AM Study
Code, learn, and conquer before the world wakes up.

## About The Project

This repository contains all the code, scripts, and notes from my daily 5 AM study sessions on my journey to becoming a world-class Site Reliability Engineer. 
This is a public log of my progress, a library of my solutions, and a testament to the power of daily, focused effort.

Here you'll find my work on various SRE topics, including:

    🐧 Linux Internals & Networking

    ☸️ Kubernetes & Containerization

    🤖 Machine learning & AI'

    💻 Programming in Python, Go and C

    ... and much more!
