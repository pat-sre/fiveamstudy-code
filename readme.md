# 5 AM Study
Code, learn, and conquer before the world wakes up.

## About The Project

This repository contains all the code, scripts, and notes from my daily 5 AM study sessions on my journey to becoming a world-class Site Reliability Engineer.  
This is a public log of my progress, a library of my solutions, and a testament to the power of daily, focused effort.  

Here you'll find my work on various SRE topics, including:

    Linux Internals & Networking

    Kubernetes & Containerization

    Machine learning & AI

    Programming in Python, Go and C
